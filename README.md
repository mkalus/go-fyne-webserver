# Go Fyne Webserver

This is a simple static webserver with a GUI frontend to start and stop it. It is useful if you have a static website
to share with your customer and he or she does not have a webserver at hand. Just create a zip, with Go Fyne Webserver
in the root directory. Create a `static` folder which contains your static website. Run the binary and you will see
a window.

Press "Start Web Server" to start the server and point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
